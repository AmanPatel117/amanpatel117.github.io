**Role:** Data Science Intern (Aug 2024 – Aug 2025, remote)

- Devised LLM‑based automated web scraping for 200+ customers.
- Built internal LangChain tools for report writing/data manipulation → **20%+** faster ingestion.
- Refactored Databricks deployment with drift monitoring.
- Led neural‑network approach to predict water‑main survival times.
