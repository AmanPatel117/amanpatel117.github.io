# Goal
The goal of this project is to create an intelligent system that uses predictive modeling to determine the optimal scheduling of electric battery balancing activities.

# Methodology
## Data
We want to train an LSTM model that can predict the next place a driver is traveling to based on a sequence of the driver's previous k stops. The data for this model was synthetically generated by sampling several random walks of length k+1 from a graph that models a driver's behavior through transition probabilities between the nodes. These transition probabilities were also randomly sampled.
