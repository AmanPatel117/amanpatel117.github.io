<p class="lead">
Hello! I'm a Master's student in Computational Data Science at Georgia Tech with a strong
foundation in mathematics and a passion for building machine learning systems that solve
real-world problems. I have experience working with data and AI across a wide variety of
fields, including finance, sustainability, academia, and tech. My current interests lie at
the intersection of data science, applied machine learning, and natural language processing
and LLMs. I'm particularly drawn to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Science</strong>: data cleaning, feature engineering, data encoding</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: statistical learning, optimization, deep learning</li>
  <li><strong>LLM Applications</strong>: prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Agentic AI</li>
</ul>
