Hello! I'm a Master's student in Computational Data Science at Georgia Tech with a strong
foundation in mathematics and a passion for building machine learning systems that solve
real-world problems. I have experience working with data and AI across a wide variety of
fields, including finance, sustainability, academia, and tech.<br><br>
My current interests lie at the intersection of data science, applied machine learning, and natural language processing
and LLMs. I'm particularly drawn to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Science</strong>: data cleaning, feature engineering, data encoding</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: statistical learning, optimization, deep learning</li>
  <li><strong>LLM Applications</strong>: prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Agentic AI</li>
</ul>

## My Projects

## Other Interests
I like to spend my free time playing all racquet sports, basketball, volleyball, going to the gym, reading science fiction, and playing video games. I also have been playing piano since I was 5 and recently took a pottery class for the first time, which was an enjoyable experience despite me not being the best at the visual arts.
